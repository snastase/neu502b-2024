In the first section, we'll use principal component analysis (PCA) to capture natural visual images as a linear combination of latent basis vectors. In the second section, we'll use a more neurally-inspired model of Hebbian learning to recover similar structure. In the third section, we'll explore the functional topography of V1 using a competitive feature-based model of ocular dominance and orientation selectivity."

    "### Problem 1: Principal component analysis of natural scenes\n",
    "Consider various attempts to formulate a theory about the function(s) of primary visual cortex (V1). Clearly V1 function cannot be entirely reduced to edge detection or Fourier decomposition, although it does perform a mixture of these functions. Simple cells are tuned to sine waveforms, yet broadly tuned to different spatial frequencies. A generative view of neural processing suggests that the early visual system may serve to identify the latent variables that generate visual stimuli (e.g. natural scenes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparse coding model suggests to represent a multidimensional visual space as linear combinations of basis vectors, requiring the weights for the linear combinations to be sparse. Olshausen and Field ([1996](https://doi.org/10.1038/381607a0)) showed that these basis vectors turn out to resemble V1 receptive fields when derived from natural scenes. This method requires \"over-completion\"—i.e. a larger number of basis vectors than sensory space vectors. On the other hand, principal component analysis (PCA) aims to represent data with the fewest number of basis vectors possible. In this problem, we'll begin by finding the principal components (PCs) that account for the most local variance in natural images."

When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hebb was describing \"spike-timing-dependent-plasticity\", where the lags between pre- and post-synaptic neurons are responsible for long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD), depending on which fires first. (The story turns out to be not so simple, but...) The simplest learning rule following this description of plasticity takes the following form:\n",

    "where $u$ is the input vector representing a pattern of activity (i.e. firing rate) across presynaptic elements, $w$ is the weight vector representing the synapse strength between pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and $v$ is a single postsynaptic output. The parameter $\\tau_w$ controls the rate at which weights between pre- and postsynaptic elements change (i.e. the time required for a fractional change in the weights). The output of the postsynaptic element $v$ is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "Inspection of V1 functional anatomy reveals alternative columns of cells that respond preferentially to input from the left and right eyes—referred to as ocular dominance columns. Hubel and Wiesel (e.g. [1977](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1977.0085)) showed that subsets of cells in V1 are selective to different orientations of bars moving across their receptive fields. The proposed the \"ice cube\" model, where columns of iso-oriented cells span each cortical column of iso-ocular cells. In the following figure, the areas separated by black lines are the ocular dominance columns, while the gray lines denote iso-orientation contours. So-called \"pinwheels\" are the singularities where all orientations converge. These structures develop as the visual system receives inputs across the spectrum of these sensory features.<br><br>\n",

One such models is the \"elastic net\" model ([Erwin et al., 1995](https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.1995.7.3.425)). Modeling cortical map formation with Hebbian models is highly complex, requiring consideration of retinotopic location, ocular dominance, and orientation preference simultaneously within the dynamics of the network. Competitive feature-based models provide a simpler framework to describe map development. These models characterize neurons and their inputs in terms of feature selectivity, unlike Hebbian models, which use synaptic weights. By the end of development, the receptive field of a cortical cell can be characterized by three values: ocularity, mean topographic location of inputs, and orientation selectivity."

The neighbors $V^{loc}_i$ are the neighbors of each cortical unit $v_i$, which fill the rows of $V^{loc}$. However, we can more efficiently compute the summation using the adjacency matrix $A$ as shown in the second line of the above equation, which alleviates the need to compute $V^loc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, $(u_i-V_i )$ means that the current stimulus vector $u_i$ is subtracted from each row of $V_i$. Next, the notation $w .*(u_i-V_i)$ means multiply each column of $(u_i-V_i )$ element-wise by the vector $w$. Both operations in $w .*(u_i-V_i )$ can be accomplished via array broadcasting.\n",
    " \n",
    "In summary, in this model the cortical unit activities are changed by two terms. In the first, the units are updated by their difference from the input $u_i$, with the weight vector $w$ serving as a normalizing force. The second term promotes units having similar selectivity to their neighbors. In the model, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ control the tradeoff between these two terms, and $\\sigma$ controls the effective range (distance) between an input and the cortical neurons. If implemented as described, the simulation can take around 10–20 minutes (you may need to `conda install tqdm` to implement a progress bar)."

Next, compute the orientation selectivity preference for each unit and plot contour lines of iso-orientation using the `countour()` function. Plot enough lines such that the contour lines represent changes of 15 degrees. Plot the ocularity map, the orientation map, and an overlaid visualization of both maps.
