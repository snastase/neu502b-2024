    "*Submission instructions:* First, rename your homework notebook to include your name (e.g. `homework-3-nastase.ipynb`); keep your homework notebook in the `homework` directory of your clone of the class repository. Prior to submitting, restart the kernel and run all cells (see *Kernel* > *Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...*) to make sure your code runs and the figures render properly. Only include cells with necessary code or answers; don't include extra cells used for troubleshooting. To submit, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` your homework to your fork of the class repository, then make a pull request on GitHub to sync your homework into the class repository.\n",

    "The **drift-diffusion model** (DDM) has been a dominant model in understanding how decisions are made. The model predicts how one makes a decision by integrating evidence over time. Part of the power of the drift-diffusion model is how simple it is. The dynamics are captured by:\n",
    "$$ dC = v \\cdot dt + w \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(0,1) $$\n",
    "Where $C$ is your decision variable, $v$ is the evidence that accumulates over time (the \"drift\"), and $w$ is the amount of noise in the integration (the \"diffusion\"). The initial condition is typically set to $C_0$ = 0 and the integration occurs to some bound $\\pm B$, which initiates the choice. To get a better intuition for how the model works, letâ€™s simulate a decision process using the drift-diffusion model."

    "First, we'll simulate a simple two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) decision process using the drift-diffusion model. The following function takes in evidence $v$ and uses a `while` loop to continue updating the decision variable $C$ until it reaches either the positive or negative decision bound $\\pm B$ (with random-normal noise scaled $w$ at each update). Make sure you understand what each line of the function is doing. We'll start with parameters $C_0$ = 0, $B$ = 1, $dt$ = 0.0005 ms, $v$ = 2.5, and $w$ = 0.05."

    "Try running 1000 simulations to get a good sense of how the model behaves. Keep the same parameters so that the only thing that differs across iterations is the noise. With positive evidence $v$ = 2.5, the \"correct\" choice is made when the model reaches the positive bound $B$ = 1; if the model reaches the negative bound, this indicates an \"incorrect\" choice. Plot the time series of accumulated evidence for several model runs (e.g. 10) to include both correct and incorrect trials. Plot model runs that terminate in a correct decision in one color, and model runs that terminate in an incorrect decision in another color. Why does the model occasionally make decision errors?"

However, in experiments, reaction times for incorrect trials are typically longer than for correct trials. To capture this effect, let's add some trial-by-trial variability: instead of a fixed $v$ for all trials, allow $v$ to vary across trials according to a normal distribution $v = 2.5 + \\mathcal{N}(0,5)$.
